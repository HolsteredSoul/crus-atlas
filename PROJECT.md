# CRUS

## Mission
Build a static, interactive educational atlas of the right lower leg, ankle and distal knee, with searchable anatomy layers and clinical landmarks. The app is not a medical device or diagnostic/surgical tool.

## Definition of done
The requested structures are independently selectable under a stable metadata contract; layer controls, focus/presets, three explode modes and all requested clinical topics are implemented. A runnable Vite app, catalogue, conditions, model attribution and GLB replacement instructions are delivered. The user rejected the initial procedural stand-in; acceptance now requires source-derived anatomy and visual review.

## Non-goals
- No diagnosis, treatment protocols or surgical guidance.
- No backend, authentication, patient data or clinical measurements.
- No claim of clinically validated geometry or registered source scans.
- No detailed full-body anatomy, complete foot musculature or new roadmap features.

## Status — where we are
- **Phase:** 2 — Source anatomy integrated; awaiting user visual review.
- **Last done:** Replaced rejected primitives with a 74-part Z-Anatomy Draco GLB, including the bony foot and source tendon/cartilage surfaces. Added Foot preset and registered clinical symbols. Five tests and production build pass; browser checks cover loading, selection, visibility, inventory/reassembly and Achilles overlay. Captured real full-leg and foot views. Documented attribution and incomplete deltoid component. No deployment.
- **Next action:** User visual review of the source model; independent anatomical validation and representative-device performance remain outstanding.
- **Synced to:** d2254dc — 2026-09-06, with uncommitted source-model integration and documentation changes. User acceptance is pending.

## Slips
- Treated procedural fallback permission as acceptable final anatomical quality; pursued publishing before visually verifying the model. User screenshots exposed the failure.
- Initial test assumed 15 clinical cards; actual 14 grouped cards cover the requested topics. Corrected the assertion and documentation.

## Stack
Vite 7, strict TypeScript, Three.js 0.180+, GLTFLoader/DRACOLoader, OrbitControls, GSAP, Lucide and a custom semantic HTML/CSS tree. Static app with bundled source-derived Draco GLB; no primitive fallback. No framework or server needed.

## Roadmap
- [x] **Phase 0 — Feasibility.** Dependencies obtainable; real GLB missing, explicitly authorized procedural fallback used.
- [x] **Phase 1 — Thin vertical slice.** Selectable 3D anatomy with detail card and controls.
- [ ] **Phase 2 — Fill out.** Controls, cards and source anatomy are integrated; user visual acceptance is pending.
- [ ] **Phase 3 — Harden.** Build and automated geometry/data/layout checks pass. Browser smoke checks pass; complete accessibility, independent anatomy and representative-device performance remain to validate.

The roadmap does not authorize additional work beyond the user's requested scope.
